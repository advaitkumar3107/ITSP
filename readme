The project consists of code for text recognition
We will be using Pytorch for developing the neural network
The initial codes will be the practice ones wherein we will check whether we know the concept or not.
We will be starting with CNNs first so that we can finally use Faster RCNNs with GPU support for faster speed.
We will also use an inbuilt text to speech software.
